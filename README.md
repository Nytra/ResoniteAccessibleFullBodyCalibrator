A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that adds a button to the T-Pose Calibration step of the Full Body Calibrator to allow completing the step if you are unable to use two controllers. The button will say "Map Trackers".

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
1. Place [AccessibleFullBodyCalibrator.dll](https://github.com/Nytra/ResoniteAccessibleFullBodyCalibrator/releases/latest/download/AccessibleFullBodyCalibrator.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs.
